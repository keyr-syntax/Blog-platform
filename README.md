Request Method: "POST"

Request Body should have username (string), email (string) and password (string). Example of request body to be sent from frontend to the backend: {
  username: "pixelflow",
  email: "pixelflow@gmail.com",
  password: "ABCabc@1234"
}

Successful Signup Response contains the following object:
 {
  success: true,
  message: "Signup Successful!",
